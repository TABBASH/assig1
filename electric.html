        <h1>electric cars</h1>
        <p>An electric car, battery electric car, or all-electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using only energy stored in batteries. Compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, electric cars are quieter, have no exhaust emissions, and lower emissions overall.[1] In the United States and the European Union, as of 2020, the total cost of ownership of recent electric vehicles is cheaper than that of equivalent ICE cars, due to lower fueling and maintenance costs.[2][3] Charging an electric car can be done at a variety of charging stations; these charging stations can be installed in both houses and public areas.[4]

            Worldwide, 6.6 million plug-in electric cars were sold in 2021, more than doubling 2020 sales, and achieving a market share of 9% of the global new car market. All-electric cars represented 71% of plug-in car sales in 2021.As of December 2021, 16 million plug-in electric cars were on the world's roads.Many countries have established government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles, tax credits, subsidies, and other non-monetary incentives while several countries have legislated to phase-out sales of fossil fuel cars, to reduce air pollution and limit climate change.</p>

                    <h1>Mercedes-Benz EQS</h1>
                    <p>As we look towards the next year in auto innovations and new car releases, it’s clear that there’s a lot to look forward to. With the Mercedes-Benz EQS, the wait is over for most of us. Uber interior luxury with a roomy and quiet cabin and dazzling drive performances make the EQS the best luxury electric car of 2022. 

                        The EQS is currently available in four variants: the entry-level EQS 350, the upgraded EQS 450+ with more power and a large dashboard, the EQS 580 4MATIC, and the sport fine-tuned AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+.
                        
                        The Mercedes-Benz EQS 450+ delivers a range of 422 miles, two electric motors, all-wheel drive, and (excitingly!) the ability to self-pilot on certain easier types of roads – for example, on the highway. It also comes with an impressive three-screen dashboard, delivering a superb cabin entertainment experience.</p>

                    <h1>Tesla Model S Plaid</h1>
                    <p>It’s fair to say that Tesla takes the wheel when it comes to leading the electric vehicle industry. The brand has released plenty of popular electric cars over recent years and each comes with its own specific highlights.

                        The Tesla Model S, originally released in 2012, was a car full to the brim with top-of-the-range features and plenty of impressive stats. It was the world’s first long-range electric vehicle and has only seen improvements since that first release. The 2022 model comes even more jampacked. 
                        
                        The base version is capable of hitting 0-60 mph in 3.7 seconds. It has an EPA-estimated 373 miles of range in its Long Range variant with a still-impressive 348 on the Performance model (for an extra $20,000). </p>

                    <h1>Porsche Taycan</h1>
                    <p>Porsche continues to build on the success of the Taycan in 2022 with more models available under the brand name. In addition to the standard Taycan, you can now purchase a range of Tourismo editions with more cargo space. The Porsche Taycan offers everything expected from the brand: incredible acceleration, aggressive styling, and an all-around sleek look. 

                        Pronounced “tie-kahn”, the Taycan is the first production electric vehicle to use a two-speed transmission and an 800-volt electrical system, promising faster speeds and almost as fast recharging times. 
                        
                        While it doesn’t hold the same strengths when it comes to range – the Turbo can reach 201 miles under optimum conditions – it’s an excellent addition to the electric vehicle market. </p>

                    <h1>BMW iX</h1>
                    <p>The BMW iX has just as impressive interiors as it has exteriors. Its intriguing looks are just one of the reasons why this electric vehicle had to make the 2022 list. Its slick design and compact size make it a perfect electric vehicle for those living in the city. 

                        The iX comes complete with a 380 mile range on a full charge. While it might mostly be a good car for commuting, it’s fun to drive and offers the option of hitting high speeds with 0 – 60mph in 4.6 seconds.
                        
                        On the road, the iX is quiet and capable, offering a smooth drive with Scandinavian-inspired interiors featuring wood, leather, and fabric trims. </p>
