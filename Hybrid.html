        <h1>Hybrid cars</h1>
        <p>A hybrid vehicle is one that uses two or more distinct types of power, such as submarines that use diesel when surfaced and batteries when submerged. Other means to store energy include pressurized fluid in hydraulic hybrids.

            The basic principle with hybrid vehicles is that the different motors work better at different speeds; the electric motor is more efficient at producing torque, or turning power, and the combustion engine is better for maintaining high speed than a typical electric motor. Switching from one to the other at the proper time while speeding up yields a win-win in terms of energy efficiency, such that it translates into greater fuel efficiency.</p>

                    <h1>Ferrari SF90 Stradale</h1>
                    <p>Meet Ferrari’s new halo model, the SF90 Stradale. Named after Ferrari’s 2019 Formula One car but with the Stradale or ‘street’ suffix, it’s the fastest road car Maranello has ever made – and yes, it’s a hybrid. The SF90 Stradale uses a 769bhp, 4.0-litre V8 and combines it with a 7.9kWh battery and three electric motors, worth an additional 217bhp. Put the two together and you get a topline figure of 986bhp, a top speed of 211mph, and most importantly here, a 0-62mph sprint time of just 2.5 seconds. It’s still practical though; the Stradale will do 16 miles of electric only driving.</p>

                    <h1>Aston Martin Valkyrie</h1>
                    <p>Likely to set a new yardstick in road car performance, the Aston Martin Valkyrie is the brainchild of Adrian Newey, chief technical officer of the Red Bull Formula One team. Built without the need to comply with F1 rules, the Valkyrie is powered by a naturally aspirated, 6.5-litre Cosworth V12 engine and battery hybrid system, which delivers a total power output of 1,140bhp.

                        The battery system, which works in a similar way to the KERS of a Formula One car, is built by Rimac, the Croatian automotive company which also produced its own limited-run electric hypercar, the Nevera.
                        
                        Aston Martin is yet to announce the Valkyrie’s official 0-60mph time, but it will likely be around 2.5 seconds. The top speed of the Valkyrie Coupe, of which just 150 will be built, is 217mph. The Spyder, limited to just 85 examples, has the same top speed with its roof panel in place, but this lowers to 205mph when driving with the wind in your hair. A track-only version called the Valkyrie AMR is expected to reach 250mph.</p>

                    <h1>McLaren Speedtail</h1>
                    <p>Intended to be a 21st century reimagining of the legendary McLaren F1 of the Nineties, the Speedtail is a three-seat hypercar with a goal of combining ultimate luxury and cross-continental comfort with a top speed of 250 mph.

                        The car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 and an electric motor sending 747bhp and 309bhp respectively, for a total combined output of 1,036bhp and 848 lb ft of torque, to the rear wheels. McLaren’s acceleration stats claim a 0-62mph time of 3.0 seconds, 124mph in 6.6 seconds, 186mph in 13.0 seconds, and a top speed of 250mph.
                        
                        Inside, the Speedtail has a three-seat layout with the driver sitting in the middle, flanked by two lucky passengers. McLaren is pitching the Speedtail  as a ‘hyper GT’ car, capable of high speed, but delivering it in a more refined, comfortable and luxurious way than the more hardcore, track-biased McLaren Senna.</p>

                    <h1>Lamborghini Countach LPI 800-4</h1>
                    <p>A retro-styled nod to the original Countach of the Seventies, the LPI 800-4 shares its platform with the Aventador and Sián, meaning a naturally-aspirated V12 engine and 48V electric motor fitted to the gearbox, producing a total output of 803bhp.

                        The motor is powered by a supercapacitor that is claimed to produce three times the power of a lithium battery of the same weight. Instead of reducing emissions and offering pure-EV driving, the supercapacitor acts to smooth out the acceleration curve and deploy torque fill between gear changes.
                        
                        Lamborghini claims a 0-62mph for the new Countach of 2.8 seconds, a 124mph sprint time of 8.6 seconds, and a top speed of 221mph. Just 112 examples will be produced.</p>
