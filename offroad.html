        <h1>off-road cars</h1>
        <p>An off-road vehicle, sometimes referred to as an overland or adventure vehicle, is considered to be any type of vehicle which is capable of driving on and off paved or gravel surface.[1] It is generally characterized by having large tires with deep, open treads, a flexible suspension, or even caterpillar tracks.[citation needed] Other vehicles that do not travel on public streets or highways are generally termed off-highway vehicles, including tractors, forklifts, cranes, backhoes, bulldozers, and golf carts.[citation needed]

            Off-road vehicles have an enthusiastic following because of their versatility. Several types of motorsports involve racing off-road vehicles. The most common use of these vehicles is for sightseeing in areas distant from the pavement.[citation needed] The use of higher clearance and higher traction vehicles enables access on trails and forest roads that have rough and low traction surfaces. Off-road vehicles can typically ford through deeper waters (i.e., rivers or floodwaters) than on-road vehicles can.</p>

                    <h1>Jeep Wrangler Rubicon</h1>
                    <p>Until Ford puts the Bronco into consumers’ hands or we see a direct head-to-head comparison, the Jeep Wrangler is the king of the castle. If you want the best of the best, look toward the Rubicon trim. While every Wrangler can go off-roading, the Rubicon is the most capable. With front and rear Dana 44 axles, 33-inch all-terrain tires, rock rails, steel bumpers, a 4:1 gear ratio, and electronic locking differentials, the Rubicon is the Wrangler to get for serious off-roading.</p>

                    </h1>
                    <p>The Toyota 4Runner is an oldie but a goodie. The SUV’s V6 may be ancient, as is its five-speed automatic transmission, but doing things the old way helps if you’re looking to go off-roading. While the 4Runner’s powertrain, platform, and design might be antique, everything else is modern. The TRD Pro comes with 2.5-inch TRD-tuned Fox shocks, TRD springs, thick skid plates, and Nitto all-terrain tires. You also get an electronic locking rear differential and Toyota’s multi-terrain select system.</p>

                    <h1>Ford Ranger Off-Road Package 3
                    </h1>
                    <p>While other markets get the Ford Ranger Raptor, America doesn’t – at least for the time being. That might change in the future, but at the moment, Ford offers three off-roading packages for the Ford Ranger. The three “Ford Performance Levels” range in capability from jalapeño to habanero – if Ford does bring the Ranger Raptor to the U.S., that would undeniably be a Carolina Reaper.

                        For the current Ranger, the Ford Performance Level 3 is the most rugged one. It combines the features from the other two packages and adds a few unique touches. An off-road suspension, Ford-tuned Fox shocks, tow hooks, off-road tires, a 40-inch light bar, an ARB winch-capable front bumper, and a sport exhaust system are all included. The Ranger’s turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder gets a boost in performance, too, producing 315 horsepower and 370 pound-feet of torque.</p>

                    <h1>Mercedes-Benz G-Class
                    </h1>
                    <p>Before the Mercedes-Benz G-Class became a must-have for celebrities, the rugged SUV started life as a capable military vehicle. While the G-Class has slowly become more and more luxurious over time, it’s still a capable off-roader at heart. You might find G-Class SUVs lined up at Starbucks, but with a two-speed transfer case, three locking differentials, and a G Mode for non-AMG models that alters the powertrain, traction control, and stability control systems, the G-Class is highly capable. Throw in the G-Class’ absurdly powerful V8 engine into the mix and you’ve got an excellent recipe to go on an adventure. </p>
